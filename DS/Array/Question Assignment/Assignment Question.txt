Q1. Write a Java program to input an array & display it.
Input
 Array Size = 5
 Array Elements = 10 20 30 40 50
Output
 10 20 30 40 50
Explanation
First, we take the size of the array from the user.
Then, elements are entered one by one into the array.
Finally, using a loop, we display all elements in the same order they were entered.


Q2. Write a Java program to calculate the sum of all elements in an array.
Input
 Array Size = 5
 Array Elements = 2 4 6 8 10
Output
 Sum of array elements = 30
Explanation
Initialize a variable sum = 0.
Traverse the array and keep adding each element to sum.
After the loop ends, sum will hold the total of all array elements.
Q3. Write a Java program to display even & odd values from an array.
Input
 Array Size = 6
 Array Elements = 11 20 33 42 55 60
Output
 Even Values = 20 42 60
 Odd Values = 11 33 55
Explanation
Traverse the array element by element.
If an element is divisible by 2, it is even. Otherwise, it is odd.
Separate lists are displayed for even and odd values.


Q4. Write a Java program to display even & odd index values from an array.
Input
 Array Size = 6
 Array Elements = 5 10 15 20 25 30
Output
 Values at Even Index = 5 15 25
 Values at Odd Index = 10 20 30
Explanation
Index starts from 0.
Even index positions are 0, 2, 4, ….
Odd index positions are 1, 3, 5, ….
We print the values according to their index category.
Q5. Write a Java program to count even & odd values from an array.
Input
 Array Size = 7
 Array Elements = 12 17 24 39 40 55 70
Output
 Count of Even Values = 4
 Count of Odd Values = 3

Q20. Write a Java program to sort a given array in ascending & descending order.

	 Input : 	Array = [12, 5, 9, 34, 1]
	Output : 	Ascending Order: [1, 5, 9, 12, 34]
Descending Order: [34, 12, 9, 5, 1]

Explanation:
Sorting means arranging elements in a particular order.
In ascending order, numbers are arranged from smallest to largest.
For example: 1 < 5 < 9 < 12 < 34.
In descending order, numbers are arranged from largest to smallest.
For example: 34 > 12 > 9 > 5 > 1.
The program should first sort the array in ascending order, then print the reverse of that order for descending.

Q21. Move all zeros in an array to the end while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements.
	Input :- arr = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
	Output :- arr = [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
Explanation:
All non-zero elements [1, 3, 12] retain their original order.
All zeros are moved to the end of the array.

Q22.Write a java program count all pairs of elements in an array whose sum is equal to a given number.
	Input :- arr = [1, 5, 7, -1, 5]        sum = 6
Output :- 3
Explanation:
Pairs whose sum = 6 are:
(1, 5) → first occurrence
(7, -1)
(1, 5) → second occurrence (from the second 5)
Total pairs = 3

Q23. Write a java program to find union array of two unsorted array.
	Input :-  arr1 = [1, 2, 3]  
   arr2 = [2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: true


Explanation:
 A palindrome reads the same forward and backward.
 Forward: 1 2 3 2 1
 Backward: 1 2 3 2 1
 Since both are the same, the array is a palindrome.
Q30. Return the first element that repeats in the array.
Input: {10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6}
Output: First repeating element is 5


Explanation:


Traverse from left:
10 → first time.
5 → first time.
3 → first time.
4 → first time.
3 → already seen earlier → repeating, but not the first repeating (we must check carefully).
5 → this was the earliest element that repeats.


Therefore, the first repeating element is 5.
Q31. Create a new array where each element is the square of the original.
Input: arr = [2, 4, 6, 8]
