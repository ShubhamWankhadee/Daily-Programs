Q26. Replace All Elements Divisible by 3 with -1.
Input: [3, 6, 7, 9, 10]
Output: [-1, -1, 7, -1, 10]


Explanation:
 Elements divisible by 3 are 3, 6, 9. These are replaced with -1. Other elements remain unchanged.
Q27. Replace First and Last Element with 0.
Input:[5, 3, 7, 2]
Output: [0, 3, 7, 0]


Explanation:
 The first element (5) and the last element (2) are replaced with 0. Middle elements remain the same.
Q28. Replace all elements in the array that are multiples of 5 with the number 5 itself.
Input: [10, 12, 15, 17, 20]
Output: [5, 12, 5, 17, 5]


Explanation:


10 is divisible by 5 → replaced with 5.
12 is not divisible by 5 → unchanged.
15 is divisible by 5 → replaced with 5.
17 is not divisible by 5 → unchanged.
20 is divisible by 5 → replaced with 5.
Q29. Check whether the given array is a palindrome.
Input: {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}
Output: true


Explanation:
 A palindrome reads the same forward and backward.
 Forward: 1 2 3 2 1
 Backward: 1 2 3 2 1
 Since both are the same, the array is a palindrome.
Q30. Return the first element that repeats in the array.
Input: {10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6}
Output: First repeating element is 5


Explanation:


Traverse from left:
10 → first time.
5 → first time.
3 → first time.
4 → first time.
3 → already seen earlier → repeating, but not the first repeating (we must check carefully).
5 → this was the earliest element that repeats.


Therefore, the first repeating element is 5.
Q31. Create a new array where each element is the square of the original.
Input: arr = [2, 4, 6, 8]
Output: newArr = [4, 16, 36, 64]
Explanation: For each index, calculate arr[i] * arr[i] and store it in the new array.
Q32. Replace each element with its factorial.
Input: arr = [3, 4, 5]
Output: arr = [6, 24, 120]
Explanation: For each element, calculate factorial using repeated multiplication, and update the array element with this value.
Q33. Count the number of prime numbers in an array.
Input: arr = [2, 5, 6, 9, 11]
Output: Count of prime numbers = 3
Explanation: Check each element if it is prime (only divisible by 1 and itself), and count such elements.
Q34. Count the number of Perfect numbers in an array.
Input: arr = [6, 28, 10, 12, 496]
Output: Count of Perfect numbers = 3
Explanation: A Perfect number is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). For each element, find sum of divisors and compare with the number, then count.
